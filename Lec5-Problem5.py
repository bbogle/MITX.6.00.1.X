L5 PROBLEM 5  (5 points possible)
The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is the largest integer that divides each of them without remainder.
For example,
gcd(2, 12) = 2
gcd(6, 12) = 6
gcd(9, 12) = 3
gcd(17, 12) = 1
A clever mathematical trick (due to Euclid) makes it easy to find greatest common divisors.
Suppose that a and b are two positive integers:
If b = 0, then the answer is a.
Otherwise, gcd(a, b) is the same as gcd(b, a % b)
See this website for an example of Euclid's algorithm being used to find the gcd.
Write a function gcdRecur(a, b) that implements this idea recursively.
This function takes in two positive integers and returns one integer.

def gcdRecur(a, b):
    '''
    a, b: positive integers

    returns: a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of a & b.

    if b > a:
        return gcdRecur(b, a)
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcdRecur(a%b, b)

print gcdRecur(6,12)
print gcdRecur(7,12)
