L6 PROBLEM 10  (5 points possible)
Consider the following sequence of expressions:

animals = { 'a': ['aardvark'], 'b': ['baboon'], 'c': ['coati']}

animals['d'] = ['donkey']
animals['d'].append('dog')
animals['d'].append('dingo')

We want to write some simple procedures that work on dictionaries to return information.

First, write a procedure, called howMany, which returns the sum of the number of values associated with a dictionary.
For example:

>>> print howMany(animals)
6
'''

animals = { 'a': ['aardvark'], 'b': ['baboon'], 'c': ['coati']}

animals['d'] = ['donkey']
animals['d'].append('dog')
animals['d'].append('dingo')

print animals

def howMany(aDict):
    '''
    aDict: A dictionary, where all the values are lists.

    returns: int, how many values are in the dictionary.
    '''
    # Your Code Here
    cnt = 0
    for e in aDict:
        cnt += len(aDict[e])
    return cnt

print howMany(animals)


def howMany2(aDict):
    '''
    Another way to solve the problem.

    aDict: A dictionary, where all the values are lists.

    returns: int, how many individual values are in the dictionary.
    '''
    result = 0
    for key in aDict.keys():
        result += len(aDict[key])
    return result
